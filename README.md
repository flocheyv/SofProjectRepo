## SofProjectRepo ##

The purpose of our third-year web-development project at ISIMA is to implement a StackOverflow-like which is a Question & Answer collaborative platform.

## How to use ##

You can find all our source code here on GitHub so you just have to download all the SofProjectRepo and then
import it in Groovy/Grails Tool Suite. Refresh dependencies if necessary and you can run our application
