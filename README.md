## SofProjectRepo ##

The purpose of our third-year web-development project at ISIMA is to implement a StackOverflow-like which is a Question & Answer collaborative platform.


## A quick tour of the features ##

Our own StackOverflow provides some nice features such as :
 - User connection feature (admin and user roles are handle)
 - Question & Answers with upvote/downvote, comment and edit possibility for each
 - Questions are tagged and you can display them by tags, views, votes and newest
 - Gamification rules : users can earn badges according to their reputation points
 - You can see all tags and badges on corresponding pages
 - Users can fill their profile and choose an avatar
 - Design effort (looks like real StackOverflow)
 

Please read our wiki for further informations. [SofProject wiki](https://github.com/flocheyv/SofProjectRepo/wiki/SofProject).


## How to use ##

You can find all our source code here on GitHub so you just have to download all the SofProjectRepo and then
import it in Groovy/Grails Tool Suite. Refresh dependencies if necessary and you can run our application
in your own browser.

There are many mock datas (users, questions, answers and so on) so you can try it faster.
You can log in with a user profile (me/password) or with an admin profile (flo/admin) to see everything and having more possibilities.

Otherwise you can try our application on our PaaS host Heroku. [SofProject Heroku](https://github.com/flocheyv/).
You can also see our project on [BuildHive CI](https://github.com/flocheyv/).
